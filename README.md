# Modeling Magnetic Connectivity of Solar Energetic Particle Events and Solar Flares

Continuation of a masters thesis by Fabian Kistler (ETH Zurich) supervised by Louise Harra (PMOD & ETH Zurich) and Nils Janiztek (PMOD & ETH Zurich).

## Description:

This project aims to model the accuracy of the magnetic connectivity tool (MCT) [4]. This is done using data from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) [3], which is condensed by the STIX team into the STIX flare list [2] (whereas we use the data from March 18, 2021, to May 31, 2024), and the STEP and EPT sensors of the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) [5].

This project contains the code used for this project and should allow its user to automate the process of finding magnetically connected flare - SEP electron events. As there are many factors influencing the accuracy of the automated process, it is advised to mainly use this in a pre-selection process or manually refine the results. Scientific advancements in the field of solar physics and improvements of our method will hopefully increase the accuracy of this automated process to a point where these manual steps will not be needed anymore.

## Usage:
All the code is tested to run with Python 3.13.2. I also strongly recommend using venv for your installation.
1. Install the requirements: ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the streamlit app: ```sh
    py -m streamlit run Code/streamlit/app.py
    ```
